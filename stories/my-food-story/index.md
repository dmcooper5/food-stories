# Introduction
This story comes from David Cooper, who grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico, but always loved the rolls his Grandma, who lived in Columbia, Missouri, would make every Christmas when they would visit.

## Sweden to the Southwest
My maternal grandmother lived in Columbia, Missouri, which we would visit every Christmas to see my extended family. Her last name was 'Lindgren', and her dad's family had immigrated from Gothenburg, Sweden. The rolls she would always cook during Christmas time were one of my family traditions, and one that my mom now cooks for Thanksgiving and Christmas, in omage of my grandma who passed away in March 2018.
